# Admin Role Management Guide

This guide provides practical instructions for administrators on how to manage user roles in Project Vibe It.

## üéØ Overview

As an administrator, you have the ability to assign and manage user roles across the platform. This guide covers the tools and processes for effective role management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Role Management Tools

### 1. Utility Scripts

The platform includes convenient scripts for role management:

#### Create Admin User
```bash
pnpm run create-admin
```
This script will prompt you for:
- Email address
- Name
- Password

#### Create Contributor User
```bash
pnpm run create-contributor
```
This script will prompt you for:
- Email address
- Name
- Password

### 2. Database Direct Management

For advanced users, you can manage roles directly in the database:

#### Using MongoDB Shell
```javascript
// Connect to your MongoDB instance
mongosh "your-connection-string"

// Assign contributor role
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "user@example.com" },
  { $set: { role: "contributor" } }
)

// Assign admin role
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "user@example.com" },
  { $set: { role: "admin" } }
)

// Check user's current role
db.users.findOne({ email: "user@example.com" }, { role: 1 })
```

#### Using MongoDB Compass
1. Connect to your database
2. Navigate to the `users` collection
3. Find the user by email
