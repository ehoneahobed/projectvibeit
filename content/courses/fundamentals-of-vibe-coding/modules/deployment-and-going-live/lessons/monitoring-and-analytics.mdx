# Monitoring and Analytics

Once your application is live, you need to keep an eye on it to ensure it's working well and to understand how users are interacting with it. This lesson covers the essential tools and strategies for monitoring your application's health and performance.

## Performance Monitoring: Uptime and Speed Tracking

**What it is:** Tools that continuously check if your website or app is online ("uptime") and how quickly it's loading for users ("speed"). They alert you if there are issues.

**Analogy:** A digital health monitor for your restaurant. It constantly checks if the lights are on, the kitchen is running, and how quickly food is being served. If something goes wrong, it immediately sends you an alert.
