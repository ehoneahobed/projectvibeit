## Soft Launch: Testing with Limited Users

**What it is:** Releasing your application to a small, controlled group of users first (e.g., friends, family, early adopters). This allows you to gather feedback, identify bugs, and test your systems under real-world conditions before a wider release.

**Analogy:** A "friends and family" night or a limited grand opening for your restaurant, allowing you to iron out any kinks before the big rush.

### Soft Launch Strategies

- More diverse feedback
- Higher risk but more data

#### 2. Feature Flags and Rollouts
**Gradual Rollout**
- Release features to small percentages of users
- Monitor performance and feedback
- Gradually increase rollout percentage
- Rollback if issues arise

**A/B Testing**
