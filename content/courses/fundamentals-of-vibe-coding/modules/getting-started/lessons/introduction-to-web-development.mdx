# Introduction to Web Development

Welcome to your journey into web development! In this lesson, we'll explore what web development is, how the web works, and what you'll learn throughout this course.

## What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It involves writing code that runs in web browsers and on web servers to deliver content and functionality to users.

### Frontend vs Backend

**Frontend Development** focuses on what users see and interact with:
- HTML (structure)
- CSS (styling)
- JavaScript (interactivity)

**Backend Development** handles the server-side logic:
- Database management
- User authentication
- API development
- Server configuration

## How the Web Works

When you visit a website, here's what happens:

1. **Browser Request**: Your browser sends a request to a web server
2. **Server Response**: The server processes the request and sends back HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
3. **Rendering**: Your browser renders the content and displays the webpage
4. **Interaction**: Users can interact with the page, triggering new requests

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this course, you'll learn:

- **HTML & CSS**: Building and styling web pages
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and dynamic content
- **React**: Building modern user interfaces
- **Next.js**: Full-stack web development
- **Database Design**: Storing and managing data
- **Deployment**: Getting your projects online

## Getting Started

Before we dive into coding, let's make sure you have the right mindset:

1. **Be Patient**: Learning to code takes time and practice
2. **Build Projects**: Apply what you learn by building real projects
3. **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for help when you're stuck
4. **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key to mastering web development

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll set up your development environment and create your first HTML page. Get ready to start coding!
