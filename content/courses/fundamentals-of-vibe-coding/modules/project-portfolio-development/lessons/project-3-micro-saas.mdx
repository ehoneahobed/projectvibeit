# Project 3: Micro-SaaS

Welcome to Project 3! This project introduces the concept of monetizing your application by building a "Micro-SaaS" â€“ a small, focused software-as-a-service product. You'll learn how to turn your coding skills into a potential revenue stream while building something valuable for users.

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a simple paid service (URL shortener, PDF tools, etc.)

**What it is:** Create a small web application that provides a specific, valuable service for which users might pay a small fee or subscription. Examples include a simple URL shortener, a tool to combine or split PDF files, or a basic image resizer.

**Analogy:** This is like setting up a small, specialized vending machine. It offers one or two useful items, and people pay a small amount to use it.
