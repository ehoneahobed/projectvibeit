# Project 4: Full-Stack SaaS

Welcome to the culmination of your Vibe Coding journey! This project involves building a more complex, complete Software-as-a-Service application, incorporating advanced concepts you've learned throughout the course. This is your opportunity to demonstrate mastery of all the skills you've developed.

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Develop a complete software-as-a-service application

**What it is:** Choose a more ambitious SaaS idea (e.g., a simple CRM for small businesses, a project management tool, a content calendar for bloggers) and build out its core features.

**Analogy:** This is like designing and building a multi-unit apartment building. It has individual units for different tenants, shared common areas, security systems, and a management office.

## Project Requirements

- Tenant onboarding and provisioning
- Resource usage tracking per tenant

**AI Collaboration Tips:**
- Use AI to help design multi-tenant database schemas
- Ask AI for tenant isolation strategies
- Get AI assistance with tenant provisioning workflows
- Use AI to implement tenant-specific features

### 2. Advanced Authentication
