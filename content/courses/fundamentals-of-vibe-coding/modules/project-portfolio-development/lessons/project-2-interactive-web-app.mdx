# Project 2: Interactive Web App

Welcome to Project 2! Now we're moving beyond static content to build an application that responds to user input and manages data. This project will introduce you to the world of dynamic web applications where users can interact with your product and their data persists across sessions.

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Create a productivity tool (todo app, habit tracker, etc.)

**What it is:** Build a functional web application that helps users manage tasks, track habits, or organize information.

**Analogy:** This is like building a digital personal assistant. It can remember things for you, remind you of tasks, and help you stay organized.

## Project Requirements

### 1. User Authentication
Users must be able to sign up, log in, and log out securely.

**Technical Requirements:**
- User registration with email/password
- Secure login/logout functionality
- Password reset capability
- Email verification (optional)
- Session management
- Protected routes for authenticated users

**AI Collaboration Tips:**
- Use AI to help implement authentication flows
- Ask AI for security best practices
- Get AI assistance with form validation and error handling

### 2. Data Persistence
User data (tasks, habits) must be saved and retrieved, even after the user closes the app and reopens it. This means using a database.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Database setup and configuration
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Data relationships and associations
- Data validation and sanitization
- Backup and recovery strategies

**AI Collaboration Tips:**
- Use AI to help design database schemas
- Ask AI for efficient query optimization
- Get AI assistance with data modeling

### 3. Real-time Updates
If a user makes a change (e.g., marks a task complete), the app should update instantly without needing a page refresh.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Real-time data synchronization
- Optimistic UI updates
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Loading states and error handling
- Offline capability (optional)

**AI Collaboration Tips:**
- Use AI to implement real-time features
- Ask AI for state management strategies
- Get AI assistance with WebSocket or polling implementations

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness
The app should be fully usable and visually appealing on mobile devices.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Touch-friendly interface design
- Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Mobile-optimized navigation
- Progressive Web App features (optional)
- Cross-platform compatibility

**AI Collaboration Tips:**
- Use AI to optimize mobile user experience
