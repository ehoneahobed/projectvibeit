# Project 1: Static Website

Congratulations on making it to Module 6! This is where all your learning comes together. We've covered the Vibe Coding mindset, powerful AI tools, core technical concepts, and essential business principles. Now, it's time to apply everything you've learned by building a portfolio of real-world projects.

Think of this module as your apprenticeship. You're not just reading about building; you're actually doing it, guided by the principles of Vibe Coding and empowered by AI. Each project will build on the last, allowing you to progressively tackle more complex challenges and solidify your skills.

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a professional business website

**What it is:** Create a website for a hypothetical business (e.g., a local coffee shop, a freelance photographer, a small consultancy).
