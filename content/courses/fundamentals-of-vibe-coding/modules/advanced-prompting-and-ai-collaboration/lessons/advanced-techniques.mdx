# Advanced Techniques

Welcome to the final lesson of Module 5! By now, you've mastered the fundamentals of prompting, learned to create mega prompts, and explored multi-agent workflows. Now we'll dive into the advanced techniques that will help you build robust, efficient, and scalable applications with AI assistance.

## Code Architecture: Designing Maintainable Systems

**What it is:** The high-level structure and organization of your code. Good architecture makes code easier to understand, modify, test, and scale over time.

### AI's Role in Architecture Design

AI can suggest architectural patterns, generate boilerplate code for different layers (e.g., data access, business logic), and even refactor existing code to improve its structure.

### Common Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Layered Architecture (N-Tier)
Separate your application into distinct layers with clear responsibilities.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Design a layered architecture for an e-commerce application with the following layers:
- Presentation Layer (React frontend)
- Business Logic Layer (Node.js services)
- Data Access Layer (Database operations)
- Infrastructure Layer (External services, logging, etc.)

Please provide:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Interface definitions between layers
- Error handling strategies
- Dependency injection patterns
- Testing strategies for each layer
```

#### 2. Microservices Architecture
Break your application into small, independent services.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Design a microservices architecture for a task management platform with the following services:
- User Service (authentication, profiles)
- Task Service (CRUD operations)
- Notification Service (emails, push notifications)
- Analytics Service (usage metrics, reporting)

Please provide:
- Service boundaries and responsibilities
- API contracts between services
- Data consistency strategies
- Service discovery and communication patterns
- Deployment and scaling considerations
```

#### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
Use events to decouple components and enable asynchronous processing.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Implement an event-driven architecture for a social media platform where:
- User actions trigger events (post created, like added, comment posted)
- Services react to events asynchronously
- Events are stored for analytics and audit trails

Please provide:
- Event schema definitions
- Event bus implementation
- Event handlers for different services
- Event sourcing patterns
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
```

### Analogy: Building Blueprint

It's not just about building a house, but designing it with a clear layout, separate rooms for different functions, and easy access for future renovations or additions. AI can help you draw up these smart blueprints.

### AI-Assisted Architecture Refactoring

**Example Prompt:**
```
Review this database code for SQL injection vulnerabilities:

[PASTE CODE]

Please identify:
