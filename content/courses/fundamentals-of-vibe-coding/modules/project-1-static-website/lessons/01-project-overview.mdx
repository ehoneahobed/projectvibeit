# Project 1: Static Website - Overview

Congratulations on making it to your first hands-on project! This is where all your learning comes together. We've covered the Vibe Coding mindset, powerful AI tools, core technical concepts, and essential business principles. Now, it's time to apply everything you've learned by building a real-world project.

Think of this module as your apprenticeship. You're not just reading about building; you're actually doing it, guided by the principles of Vibe Coding and empowered by AI. This project will give you hands-on experience with modern web development practices.

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a professional business website

**What it is:** Create a website for a hypothetical business (e.g., a local coffee shop, a freelance photographer, a small consultancy).

- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, modern design that builds trust
- **Contact Forms**: Ways for customers to get in touch

4. **Local Bakery** - "Sweet Dreams"
