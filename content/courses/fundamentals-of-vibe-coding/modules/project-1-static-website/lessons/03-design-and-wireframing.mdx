# Day 2: AI-Powered Design and Visual Planning

Today we'll leverage AI to create the visual foundation for your website. Instead of learning traditional design tools, you'll learn how to effectively communicate with AI to generate wireframes, design systems, and visual concepts that align with your business goals.

## Step 1: AI-Generated Wireframes and Layouts

### Understanding AI Design Generation

With Vibe Coding, you don't need to manually create wireframes. Instead, you'll use AI to generate layout concepts based on your business requirements and target audience.

### AI Collaboration: Layout Generation

```

```

## Step 4: Platform-Specific Design Implementation

### Converting Design Concepts to Platform Prompts

Now that you have your design system, create specific prompts for your chosen platform:
