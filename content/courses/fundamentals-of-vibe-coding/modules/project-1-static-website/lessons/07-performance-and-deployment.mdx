# Day 6-7: Performance and Deployment

Congratulations! You've built a complete website. Now it's time to optimize it for performance, implement SEO best practices, test everything thoroughly, and deploy it to the world. These final steps will ensure your website is fast, searchable, and ready for real users.

## Day 6: Performance and SEO Optimization

### Step 1: Image Optimization

#### Image Compression and Formats

Optimize your images for web performance:

```html
<!-- Optimized image with multiple formats -->
<picture>
    <source srcset="/images/hero.webp" type="image/webp">
    <source srcset="/images/hero.jpg" type="image/jpeg">
    <img src="/images/hero.jpg" alt="Hero image description" loading="eager">
</picture>

<!-- Lazy loaded images -->
<img src="/images/placeholder.jpg" 
     data-src="/images/service-1.jpg" 
     alt="Service description" 
     loading="lazy" 
     class="lazy">
```

#### Image Optimization Tools

**Free Online Tools:**
- **TinyPNG** - Compress PNG and JPEG images
- **Squoosh** - Google's image optimization tool
- **Convertio** - Convert images to WebP format
- **ImageOptim** - Mac app for image optimization

**Command Line Tools:**
```bash
# Install ImageOptim CLI
npm install -g imageoptim-cli

# Optimize images in a directory
imageoptim images/

# Convert to WebP using cwebp
cwebp -q 80 input.jpg -o output.webp
```

#### Responsive Images

Implement responsive images for different screen sizes:

```html
<!-- Responsive hero image -->
<picture class="hero-image">
    <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" srcset="/images/hero-large.webp">
    <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="/images/hero-medium.webp">
    <source srcset="/images/hero-small.webp">
    <img src="/images/hero-small.jpg" alt="Hero image" class="hero-img">
</picture>
```

### AI Collaboration: Image Optimization

```
"Optimize images for my [business type] website:
Business: [your business name]
Image types: [hero, services, about, etc.]
Performance goals: [fast loading, good quality]

Please provide:
- Image optimization strategies
- WebP conversion recommendations
- Responsive image implementation
- Lazy loading setup
- Image compression settings"
```

### Step 2: CSS and JavaScript Optimization

#### CSS Optimization

Minify and optimize your CSS:

```css
/* Critical CSS - Inline in HTML head */
.hero,.hero .container,.hero-content,.hero-title,.hero-subtitle,.hero-actions{display:flex}.hero{min-height:80vh;align-items:center;background:linear-gradient(135deg,#007bff 0%,#6c757d 100%);color:#fff;padding:4rem 0}.hero .container{max-width:1200px;margin:0 auto;padding:0 1rem;grid-template-columns:1fr;gap:3rem;align-items:center}.hero-content{text-align:center;flex-direction:column}.hero-title{font-size:2.25rem;font-weight:700;margin-bottom:1.5rem;line-height:1.1}.hero-subtitle{font-size:1.25rem;margin-bottom:3rem;opacity:.9;max-width:600px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}

/* Non-critical CSS - Loaded asynchronously */
<link rel="preload" href="/css/style.css" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
<noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css"></noscript>
```

#### JavaScript Optimization

Optimize your JavaScript for performance:

```javascript
// Minified and optimized JavaScript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){const e=document.querySelector('.mobile-menu-toggle'),t=document.querySelector('.nav-mobile');e&&t&&e.addEventListener('click',function(){const e=this.getAttribute('aria-expanded')==='true';e?closeMobileMenu():openMobileMenu()});function openMobileMenu(){t.hidden=!1,e.setAttribute('aria-expanded','true'),document.body.style.overflow='hidden'}function closeMobileMenu(){t.hidden=!0,e.setAttribute('aria-expanded','false'),document.body.style.overflow=''}});

// Load JavaScript asynchronously
<script src="/js/main.js" defer></script>
```

#### Build Process

Set up a simple build process:

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run minify-css && npm run minify-js && npm run optimize-images",
    "minify-css": "cleancss -o css/style.min.css css/style.css",
    "minify-js": "uglifyjs js/main.js -o js/main.min.js",
    "optimize-images": "imageoptim images/"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "clean-css-cli": "^5.6.0",
    "uglify-js": "^3.17.4"
  }
}
```

### AI Collaboration: Code Optimization

```
"Optimize CSS and JavaScript for my [business type] website:
Business: [your business name]
Performance goals: [fast loading, smooth interactions]
Build process: [minification, compression]

Please provide:
- CSS minification and optimization
