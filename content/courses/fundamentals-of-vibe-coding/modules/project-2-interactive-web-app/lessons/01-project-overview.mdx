# Project 2: Interactive Web App - Overview

Welcome to Project 2! Now we're moving beyond static content to build an application that responds to user input and manages data. This project will introduce you to the world of dynamic web applications where users can interact with your product and their data persists across sessions.

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Create a productivity tool (todo app, habit tracker, etc.)

**What it is:** Build a functional web application that helps users manage tasks, track habits, or organize information.

**Analogy:** This is like building a digital personal assistant. It can remember things for you, remind you of tasks, and help you stay organized.

## What You'll Build

You'll create a complete web application that includes:

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup, login, and user management
- **Data Persistence**: Information that saves and loads across sessions
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant changes without page refreshes
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Works perfectly on all devices
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can create, edit, and manage their data

## Getting Started

In the next lesson, we'll dive into **Project Planning and Architecture** where you'll:
- Choose your app concept and features
- Design your technical architecture
- Plan your database schema
- Define your API endpoints
- Set up your development environment

This project will give you hands-on experience with full-stack development, teaching you how to build applications that users can actually interact with and rely on for their daily tasks.
