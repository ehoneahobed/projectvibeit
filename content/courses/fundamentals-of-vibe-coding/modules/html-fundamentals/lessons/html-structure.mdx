# HTML Document Structure

Every HTML document follows a specific structure that browsers understand and use to render web pages. In this lesson, you'll learn the essential components that make up a well-formed HTML document.

## The Basic HTML Template

Every HTML document starts with this basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Understanding Each Component

### 1. DOCTYPE Declaration

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

The DOCTYPE declaration tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document. It must be the very first line of your HTML file.

### 2. HTML Element

```html
<html lang="en">
```

The `<html>` element is the root element of your document. The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the document, which helps with accessibility and SEO.

### 3. Head Section

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
```

The `<head>` section contains metadata about your document:

- **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**: Specifies character encoding
- **`<meta name="viewport">`**: Makes the page responsive on mobile devices
- **`<title>`**: Sets the page title (appears in browser tab)

### 4. Body Section

```html
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
```

The `<body>` section contains all the visible content of your webpage.

## Essential Meta Tags

### Character Encoding
```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```
This ensures proper display of special characters and emojis.

### Viewport
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
This makes your page responsive and properly scaled on mobile devices.

### Description
```html
<meta name="description" content="A brief description of your page">
```
This helps with SEO and appears in search results.

## Complete Example

Here's a complete HTML document with all essential elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="Learn about HTML document structure">
    <title>HTML Document Structure - Learning HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to HTML Learning</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#basics">Basics</a></li>
                <li><a href="#structure">Structure</a></li>
                <li><a href="#practice">Practice</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section id="basics">
            <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
            <p>HTML is the foundation of web development.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="structure">
            <h2>Document Structure</h2>
            <p>Every HTML document has a specific structure.</p>
        </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 HTML Learning. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Include DOCTYPE
Never skip the DOCTYPE declaration - it's essential for proper rendering.

### 2. Use Semantic Elements
Use meaningful HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.

### 3. Set Language Attribute
Always include the `lang` attribute for accessibility and SEO.

### 4. Include Viewport Meta Tag
Essential for responsive design on mobile devices.

### 5. Use Descriptive Titles
Make your page titles descriptive and unique.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Missing DOCTYPE**: Can cause rendering issues
- **No viewport meta tag**: Mobile devices won't display properly
- **Missing charset**: Special characters may not display correctly
- **No language attribute**: Hurts accessibility and SEO
- **Empty title**: Bad for SEO and user experience

## Practice Exercise

Create a simple HTML document about your favorite hobby. Include:

1. Proper DOCTYPE and HTML structure
2. Meaningful title and description
3. Header with navigation
4. Main content with sections
5. Footer with copyright information
