# Project: Create a Product Specification

For your project in this module, you will apply the concepts learned by creating a product specification for a hypothetical SaaS project. This will involve:

- Defining your target user (from User Research)
- Identifying a problem your SaaS product will solve
- Outlining the core features of your MVP (from MVP Strategy)
- Suggesting a primary business model (from Subscription Models)
- Drafting a simple Product Requirements Document (PRD) that summarizes these points

This project will help you integrate the business and product thinking into your Vibe Coding journey, preparing you to build solutions that not only work but also thrive.

## Project Overview

```

## Step 3: Identify the Problem

### Problem Statement Framework

#### Current State
